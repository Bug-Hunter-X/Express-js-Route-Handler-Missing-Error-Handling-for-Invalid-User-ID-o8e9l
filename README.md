# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the `/users/:id` route fails to handle cases where `:id` is not a valid user ID, potentially leading to database errors or unexpected responses.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches user data based on a provided ID. However, it lacks error handling for invalid IDs.  If an invalid ID is provided, the application may crash or return an unexpected response.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a corrected version of the route handler. It includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage invalid user IDs, providing informative error responses to the client.
